## Basics

Primitive data types only store a single value

Objects store keyed collection of multiple data.

It has 2 properties:
1. `key`: Identifier
2. `value`: Actual data

To delete a property from the object, `delete` operator can be used.

```js
delete user.age;
```

Multiword names can be used as key.

```js
let anime = {
	name: "Re:zero",
	"japanese title": false,
}
```

You can't access multi-word properties with `.` operator.

```js
// <--------- Wrong way ----------->
// Syntax error
anime.japanese title = true;

// <-------- Proper way------------>
anime["japanese title"] = true;
delete anime["japanese title"];
```

There are no limitations on property names. They can be any strings or symbols (a special type for identifiers, to be covered later).

There’s a minor gotcha with a special property named `__proto__`. We can’t set it to a non-object value:

```js
let obj = {};
obj.__proto__ = 5; // assign a number
alert(obj.__proto__); // [object Object] - the value is an object, didn't work as intended
```

### `in` operator

To check if a key exists in object, we can use `in` operator.

```js
"key" in object
```

**Importance / Need of `in` operator:**

So what we can do with `in` can be done via the following.

```js
let user = {
	anime: true
}

if(user.anime === undefined) {
	console.log("Property does not exists")
}
```

But there are some special cases

```js
let user = {
	anime: undefined
}

if(user.anime === undefined) {
	console.log("Propery does not exists") // This will execute, which is wrong
}

if( "anime" in user) {
	console.log("Property exists") // This is also execure, which is correct.
}
```

#### `for ... in` loop

A loop to iterate over keys of an object.

```js
const anime = {
	name: "Re:Zero",
	seasons: 3
	"airing status": "airing_now"
}

for(let key in object) { 
	console.log(`
		key: ${ key },
		value: ${ anime[key] }
		
	`)
}
```

#### Order of keys

1. Integers come first in order(not floating point number). Coercion occurs from string number.
2. Everything else is in creating order

## Object reference and copying

Unlike primitives, objects are copied by reference.

```js
const user = {
name: "sarthak"
}

let copyObj = user;

copyObj.name = "subaru";
console.log(user);

//Output: { name: 'subaru' }
```

So to copy a object, there are multiple ways

1. **Manually run a loop to copy to another object:**

   This works when there are no nested objects.

```js
let user = {
name: "John",
age: 30
};

let clone = {}; // the new empty object

// let's copy all user properties into it

for (let key in user) {
	clone[key] = user[key];
}

// now clone is a fully independent object with the same content

clone.name = "Pete"; // changed the data in it

alert( user.name ); // still John in the original object
```

2. **`Object.assign()`:**
   Just like previous method, this does deep cloning for top level primitives. Any **nested objects will be referneced**.

```js
let user = { name: "Sarthak" };

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);

user.name = "Subaru";

console.log(clone); // { name: "Sarthak" }
```

3. **`structuredClone`:** 

   Clones all nested objects. Proper deep cloning.

```js
let user = {};
// let's create a circular reference:
// user.me references the user itself
user.me = user;

let clone = structuredClone(user);
alert(clone.me === clone); // true
```

`structuredCloone` also fails in some instance like in case of functions:


```js
// error
structuredClone({
   f: function() {}
});
```

Lodash library's custom `_.cloneDeep(obj)` handles this.

## Garbage collection

Garbage collector fees the allocated memory automatically.

### Reachability

Reachable values are those which are accessible or usable somehow. They are guaranteed to be stored in memory.

- Outgoing references do not matter. Only Incoming.

---
## Object methods: `this`

In JS, methods are functions and objects can have function inside them.

```js
let user = {
	sayHi() {
		console.log("Hii!");
	}
}
```

`this` method is used to access properties of the object. For instance:

```js
const user = {
	name: "Sarthak",
	sayHi() {
		console.log(`Hii, ${ this.name }`);
	}
}
```

The same can be done via using:

```js
const user = {
	name: "Sarthak",
	sayHi() {
		console.log(`Hii, ${ user.name }`);
	}
}
```

But this method is unreliable. Here's a example:

```js
let user = {
	name: "John",
	age: 30,
	
	sayHi() {
	    alert( user.name ); // leads to an error
	}
};
  
let admin = user;

user = null; // overwrite to make things obvious

admin.sayHi(); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null
```

If we use `this` instead of directly referencing the object, it will work.

The value of `this` is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.

```js
let user = { name: "John" };
let admin = { name: "Admin" };

function sayHi() {
	alert( this.name );
}

// use the same function in two objects
user.f = sayHi;
admin.f = sayHi;

// these calls have different this
// "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"
user.f(); // John (this == user)
admin.f(); // Admin (this == admin)

admin['f'](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method – doesn't matter)
```

**Info bit:** If not context is provided, `this` is `undefined` when in strict mode. Else it refers to `window` object in browser and global object.

#### `this` in Arrow functions: A special case

Arrow functions don’t have their “own” `this`. If we reference `this` from such a function, it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.

For instance, here `arrow()` uses `this` from the outer `user.sayHi()` method:

```js
let user = {
	firstName: "Sarthak",
	sayHi() {
		let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
		arrow();
	}
};

user.sayHi(); // Sarthak
```

In summary, the value of `this` in JavaScript depends on **how** a function is called, not where it is defined.
1. **In a function (called normally):**
    - If `strict mode` is enabled: `this` is `undefined`.
    - If `strict mode` is not enabled: `this` is `window` (in browsers).
2. **In a method (called with dot syntax `obj.method()`):**
    - `this` refers to the object before the dot (`obj`).
3. **In an arrow function:**
    - `this` is inherited from its surrounding function.


**Interesting questing:** What is the answer

```js
function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: "John",
    ref: this
  };
}

let user = makeUser();

alert(user.ref.name);
```

### Constructer object

To create multiple objects of same type .

Can be done using constructor functions and the `"new"` operator.

#### Constructer function

Follows 2 conventions:
1. They are named with capital letter first.
2. They should be executed only with `"new"` operator.

```js
function User(name) {
	this.name = name;
	this.isAdmin = false;
}

let user = new User("Jack");

alert(user.name); // Jack
alert(user.isAdmin); // false
```

Execution process:
1. Empty object is created and assigned to `this`.
2. Function executes and usually modifies `this` to add properties.
3. The value of `this` is returned.

```js
function User(name) {
	// this = {}; (implicitly)
	// add properties to this
	this.name = name;
	this.isAdmin = false;
	// return this; (implicitly)
}
```

**Quick shots:**

- `new.target`
- `new User()` == `new User` (true)
-  Only return in function returns `this` ( `return;` )

---
### Optional Chaining

**Definition:** The optional chaining `?.` is a safe way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn’t exist.

- Return property if exists otherwise `undefined`.
- Relatively new. Not supported in older browser versions.
- **Short circuiting:** `?.` immediately stops the evaluation if left part doesn't exist.
- `?.` is for the value before it, not any further.
- `?.` is not a method, it's a syntax.
- Also can be used with functions `?.()` and `?.[]` syntax.

```js
user.someFunc?.();

user?.[key];
```

- Can be used with `delete` operator.

```js
delete user?.name; // delete user.name if user exists
```

- The optional chaining `?.` has no use on the left side of an assignment.

```js
let user = null;

user?.name = "John"; // Error, doesn't work

// because it evaluates to: undefined = "John"
```

---
### Symbol

**Definition:** A symbol is a “primitive unique value” with an optional description.

- Symbols are guaranteed to be unique, even if the description is same.

```js
const id1 = Symbol("id")
const id2 = Symbol("id")

console.log( id1 === id2 ) //false
```

- **Hidden property:** Symbols can be used as a key in a object what can not be accidentally accessed via other properties.

```js
let user = { // belongs to another code
	name: "John"
};

let id = Symbol("id");

user[id] = 1;

alert( user[id] ); // we can access the data using the symbol as the key
```

- Symbols are skipped by `for...in` loop.
- `Object.key(obj)` also ignores them.
- `Symbol.for(key)` returns a symbol by name.
- `Symbol.keyFor(symbol)` returns name by symbol.

```js
// get symbol by name
let sym = Symbol.for("name");
let sym2 = Symbol.for("id");

// get name by symbol
alert( Symbol.keyFor(sym) ); // name
alert( Symbol.keyFor(sym2) ); // id
```

### Object to primitive conversion

**Conversion rules:**
1. There is no conversion to Booleans. All objects are `true`.
2. The numeric conversion happens when we subtract objects or apply mathematical functions. For instance, `Date` objects (to be covered in the chapter [Date and time](https://javascript.info/date)) can be subtracted, and the result of `date1 - date2` is the time difference between two dates.
3. As for the string conversion – it usually happens when we output an object with `alert(obj)` and in similar contexts.
